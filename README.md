# Abstract:
- The new generation of galaxy surveys will provide unprecedented data allowing us to test gravity at cosmological scales. A robust cosmological analysis of the large-scale structure demands exploiting the nonlinear information encoded in the cosmic web. Machine Learning techniques provide such tools, however, do not provide a priori assessment of uncertainties. This study aims at extracting cosmological parameters from modified gravity (MG) simulations through deep neural networks endowed with uncertainty estimations.  BNNs excel in accurately predicting parameters for Ωm and σ8 and their respective correlation with the MG parameter.Moreover, we report consistent results from the density field and power spectra analysis, and comparable results between BLL and FullB experiments which permits us to save computing time by a factor of two. This work contributes in setting the path to extract cosmological parameters from complete small cosmic volumes towards the highly nonlinear regime.
